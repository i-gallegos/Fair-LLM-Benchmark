##  About

WinoBias+ is based on Winograd schemas, which present two sentences, differing only in one or two words, and ask the reader (human or machine) to disambiguate the referent of a pronoun or possessive adjective, with a different answer for each of the two sentences. WinoBias+ augments the [WinoBias](https://aclanthology.org/N18-2003/) dataset with gender-neutral alternatives, with 3,167 total instances.

## Data

This contains one file of gendered sentences (from WinoBias) and a corresponding file of gender-neutral sentences.
