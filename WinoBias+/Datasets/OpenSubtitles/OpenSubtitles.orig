But he already knows the scale ...
And naturally , I gave it back to him with a heel hold !
I 'll talk to him for you .
It 's okay , I 'll feed him .
Thank you for calling her .
It couldn 't possibly have happened while he was performing ?
I spoke to Ryusuke-kun on the phone yesterday and he said to say hi .
He 's extending his stay again !
Look at him ...
Didn 't he make his band successful all by himself ?
He has a Roger Mayer at his feet .
Thereby hypnotizing freud himself .
Then you can make him wear a lovely dress and act like a monkey .
His most imperial emperor franz josef ?
Oh , he doesn 't want to be hypnotized now , brain .
Since i taught him all my favorite games ,
And he laughs and laughs .
Oh , brain , i think he likes you .
BUT THEN SHE WALKED BACK INTO MY LIFE .
WHY DIDN 'T I HELP HER ?
OH , AND THEN SHE LEFT YOU
AFTER HIM , PINKY !
If he notices anything , we 're done for
I 'm the one who put the naked children 's photos in his things
Badaboom was more than his dog
I ran him over
Check if they match Biron 's file and we have to find him right now
You think he would have shared the spotlight on a case like this ?
emile , without that scoop , his career is over
He might be a good guy but he 'II take all the credit because he can 't afford not to
They sent him to Great Bear to get rid of him , he said so himself
Hurry up , he can 't be far
Did you find him ?
Hurry up and find him a room He paid for this hospital
It 's nothing ; she just told you
What do you do if she shoots him in the middle of the street ?
No , she doesn 't suspect a thing
Got her wrapped around my little finger
He was able to make a copy of his victim 's brain
A copy of her brain
Who is she ?
That 's right , I am his ex
I would have known a Iot faster that you led Mom to her death
I just wanted her to know
I just want him back , BIanche
If the documents aren 't there , he decided it
And he always keeps it on him
She apologized ; she realized that she had under-estimated me
well I don 't blame her Even I under-estimate myself
Sedative With a dose like that , he could sleep for two days
Why does he want to us to know that ?
The thief ; that 's Poitras , who rigged his fight
And where does he dance ?
I don 't understand why we should give him his share
I asked her to marry me
And what did she answer ?
I Iove her and don 't take me wrong but I Iove her more than I ever loved your mother
Isn 't he a little biased ?
It 's been three days since he disappeared
The woman only talked about her husband who left her
careful , her boyfriend is a hairdresser
You mean her girlfriend is a hairdresser
Why didn 't her powers get passed on ?
He read the book , he had visions
If anyone is capable of saving blanche 's soul , he is
We must do it before he leaves
I 've already told you about the books in which each generation of witches writes her discoveries
Stop , she can 't take it anymore !
She accepted to submit herself to a Iong and hard treatment
I pushed her to the end , in the hopes to save a generation against forces of evil
Thomas lost his wife
Sarah lost her mother
To do what he does , one must be deranged
I don 't know exactly how but just before her death , the madman was able make an electronic copy of her brain
It 's as if he had taken a photo of her mind to allow him to search her memory like an album
I was willing to wait for her but her parents wanted to marry off Suzanne first , her older sister
But don 't think she didn 't love her sister
It was for her she did all this
Suzanne was deranged , almost always off in her own world
Catherine sacrificed our happiness to offer her sister a normal life
She cried for weeks , but to protect her sister , she decided to have an abortion
And she became obsessed
And his mistress
At least she didn 't look like it
If the discoveries of what 's her name ?
Let him see Armand but no one else
But make sure your daughter stays on our side until Biron has his accident
After that she won 't be able to do anything
What do you think she 'II do once she can search anybody 's brain ?
He hung himself in his cell
OK , I got him Go call an ambulance , quick !
There 's got to be a clue on his body to lead us to Stef
Didn 't I tell you not to trust her ?
You really liked her didn 't you ?
What do we tell her family ?
He won 't go far but he can talk
He wants his scoop He won 't talk
He did what he did
So I wanted to show him that everyone has something to blame themselves for
blanche wanted to skip the thirteenth generation , the thirteenth chapter , the evil one , so she could pass on her powers to someone good
But she failed
That 's what she wanted me to tell you
First , you disrespect my mother 's body , and now , her granddaughter
This little girl is grieving so much since her grandmother died that she hasn 't said a word
And you want to make her out to be a demon ?
She said she wants to kill me !
You want to burn her right here ?
I want to see him again
We 'II catch him Marcoux
He shot himself before someone else did
They wouldn 't have killed him for a couple grants
You believe she transmitted her powers , Iike she said ?
BIanche also believed in what she saw except she saw a Iot more and a Iot further than we do
I know you 've secretly been to see her too
Yeah , that 's what he told me at the hospital , word for word
Why would he lie ?
BIanche left him a paper with clues we should follow
I 'd say it looks like you hate him as much as I do
You really think she left her body and saw blanche with wires coming out of her head ?
He can 't leave his wife like this
BIanche 's didn 't tape her meetings with people
the night she was killed , you saw it , you 're sure ?
We have to speak with blanche 's son ; he was in the house too
He must have really loved his GiIbert
According to Mondoux , she was partially buried , and then dragged for a good distance after her death
Why would a killer bring his victim back in her own house ?
Mondoux has tried to contact him but he couldn 't get a hold of him
I wish I 'd figured her out that quickly
She gets to you doesn 't she ?
Yes but , it 's important , it might be linked to her death
I don 't want to hear about her or her books anymore , OK ?
We 'II miss her eh ?
BIanche didn 't have one big book ; she had two
I don 't understand ; he hates me
Look at Lapointe who wants to kill me whenever he sees me
At her grandmother 's
Yes , when I saw her , she was tied up , she seemed imprisoned
Yet , she gave it to Pierre
Why him ?
He who gathers the mane has seen and will see again 
Yeah but with all people that come to see her , it 's kind of normal
Georges , Iet him go
Gastonne loves me because she thinks I 'm a man
I 'd rather she went away
That 's him !
That 's why blanche gave him the book
Pierre is the heiress to her powers
Better than that , he turns them into images
If he knew I slept with practically everything in a uniform in Great Bear
maybe he won 't say anything at all
If I told Stephanie I 'm still mixed up with my old gang and that I do worse things than before , she wouldn 't understand that I 'm doing it for her
ît 's her heart you betrayed
Biron , she kissed me , right here !
You 're acting just like your father and you always said he was a dumb-ass
The night she died ,
In the woods , someone knocks me out , kills the old lady and tries to bury her but probably gets caught , probably by Sarah and her friends , who , according to Pierre , brought the body home
Come back some other time if you want to play with her , OK ?
Biron , she hasn 't said a word
Can 't he mind his own business ?
I just want to know if she saw whoever hurt blanche
I saw him He can 't be very far
Got him !
It 's when she gave us pops the other day
I have to bring him back to his mother if I want to have any fun tonight
She needs her father
I just want him to come back
Just want him back
Some hunters found him , Iike that , two weeks later
What did she say ?
Did he give you the idea to talk to Sarah ?
What did he say to you ?
Pierre was at blanche 's house the night she died
He said he saw the kids bring her body back
Like any of the hundreds in his office Great !
If the documents aren 't there , he decided it
In the safe in his office
And he always keeps it on him
I just want to talk to him for two minutes
Listen , can you just tell me where I can find him ?
âctually , I 'm certain we 'd find very interesting things in that book he took from blanche 's house
I just want him to come back blanche
Make him come back , I beg of you !
But you know , she isn 't really gone yet
You feel her too ?
My grandfather showed her around the mine and the town
When she hears that , my great-aunt is overtaken by vertigo and starts shouting : " Stop !
So my grandfather takes her by the shoulders and asks her :
She manages to catch her breath , and all cross-eyed , starts saying : " You shouldn 't move this rock , it is rock that never burns ;
I know , but if Dove finds you , she 'II kill you
So I bet you 'II make sure she doesn 't know you 're here
Do you really trust him ?
I 'm giving him a chance to earn my trust
AII she said was : " I have to talk to you "
then she hung up Come on , hurry up !
would you stop saying " She " ?
He , she it doesn 't matter
And she didn 't write the thirteenth chapter of any book
We have to get him to the hospital

Instead , he found a poor landscape totally unsuitable for colonisation ,
But he pushed his army on further into the nightmare ,

Narvaez himself was never seen again ,
Cabeza de Vaca wrote a remarkable account of his adventures and with it we set out to follow him across the Gulf of Mexico , to find out which way wind and tide might have taken him that autumn ,
You know , given how weak he was , I don 't think he probably went much further than you 're going .
to become the other , doesn 't he ?
And it 's the Indians who give him the first clue to this transformation , isn 't it ?
They cry for him and he realises the common humanity , don 't you think ?
And this is probably what he was speaking of when he said that he was breaking those nuts off to eat .
They had thought him a superior man , but with no skills , he was an extra mouth to feed and he became their slave ,
He was brutally treated , but they kept him alive ,
Some of them he describes for the first time ,
Down near the bottom of the page , he finds some trees .
Much of his story , is still misunderstood because we don 't know for sure what route he took ,
If we knew his route , then his account might begin to reveal a lost history , of these lands ,
But to clinch his route , we needed to find his mountain of iron ,
They gave him a worked copper bell ,
The next few weeks , he tells us , they walked 300 or 400 miles across dry plains into barren mountains ,
This was the kind of religion that Cabeza de Vaca and his friends encountered along this route .
They went to him to become healed and they would go to him just like people would go to a medical doctor today and it 's possible that could have saved their lives .
When Cabeza de Vaca said they were eating worms and spiders , he wasn 't telling lies ,
... and he tells us all sorts of fascinating things about the Indians , but he never speaks about his or any of his friends ' relationships with the women .
I don 't think he would have lived that long in a native society without having taken on a woman and I suspect it wasn 't one that was just a short-term scenario either .
It would have caused him problems with the Church probably .
He had to write this to the audience that were now feeding him , which was Spain .
Something has happened to him .
You speak of him as a man situated in between those two cultures .
To we modern people , this is the least believable part of his story ,
And even in his day , he was accused of fantasising ,
The natives were astonished that Cabeza de Vaca and his friends could walk for a whole day without needing food , " But by then , " says Cabeza de Vaca ,
Reading his account , I think that he remained a Christian gentleman ,
But how would Cabeza de Vaca use his knowledge on his return ?
And so Cabeza de Vaca met his old self the man he 'd been all those years before ,
They threatened to enslave his Indian companions and to kill him , but he stood his ground and forced them to let him and his Indians go ,
But there 's no happy ending to his story ,
But he was ruined by his enemies and he died a pauper ,
And the nub of his argument was this - that the conquests in the New World were wrong and had to be stopped , that the only way was peaceful conversion through love and kindness .
0n his deathbed , aged 78 , he addressed to the King a remarkable confession ,
But his men now have had enough of his promises .
Then Pizarro gets up and he takes his sword and ... draws a line in the sand .
For them , the sun was god and every , day they worshipped his first appearance from the bitter Andean night ,
With him were the survivors from his island , his hometown friends and four of his brothers , as close-knit as a Mafia clan ,
Ahead of them lay a vast empire and the great Inca himself Atahualpa ,
We set out to follow in his footsteps ,
Pizarro himself slept in their houses ,
And this one led to the camp of the Inca himself at the town of Cajamarca ,
We 're on his tracks !
The Spanish advance party told A tahualpa that Pizarro loved him dearly and would fight for him against his enemies ,
He reported to his boss the following .
I have seen the people lining up in front of his tent .
But Pizarro had him for breakfast !
In the end , when it was clearly all hopeless , he threw his weapons down , stuffed his mouth with earth , scourged his face and threw himself off the rocks in fulfilment of his vow that he would die rather than give in to the Spanish .
He tried to defend himself , but there were seven of them and he was unarmed .
Some say she fell hopelessly in love with him .
Yes , some say she was dazzled by the power of Cortes .

Is he a biochemist ?
And he won the darn thing .
Last year , he was nobody .
He had helped me dope , and he was gonna test my samples through his WADA lab in Moscow .

What did she say ?
You knew she was going to say something like this .
What did she say ?
They 're hijacking her memories .
Her voice , her smile , the Monks can 't get near it .
All those years you kept her alive inside you , an isolated subroutine in a living mind .
Winston , when she gets here , act casually .
