But they already knows the scale ...
And naturally , I gave it back to them with a heel hold !
I 'll talk to them for you .
It 's okay , I 'll feed them .
Thank you for calling them .
It couldn 't possibly have happened while they were performing ?
I spoke to Ryusuke-kun on the phone yesterday and they said to say hi .
They are extending their stay again !
Look at them ...
Didn 't they make their band successful all by themselves ?
They have a Roger Mayer at their feet .
Thereby hypnotizing freud themselves .
Then you can make them wear a lovely dress and act like a monkey .
Their most imperial emperor franz josef ?
Oh , they don 't want to be hypnotized now , brain .
Since i taught them all my favorite games ,
And they laugh and laughs .
Oh , brain , i think they like you .
BUT THEN They WALKED BACK INTO MY LIFE .
WHY DIDN't 'T I HELP HER ?
OH , AND THEN They LEFT YOU
AFTER HIM , PINKY !

Badaboom was more than their dog
I ran them over
Check if they match Biron 's file and we have to find them right now

emile , without that scoop , their career is over
They might be a good guy but they 'II take all the credit because they can 't afford not to
They sent them to Great Bear to get rid of them , they said so themselves
Hurry up , they can 't be far
Did you find them ?
Hurry up and find them a room They paid for this hospital
It 's nothing ; they just told you
What do you do if they shoot them in the middle of the street ?
No , they don 't suspect a thing
Got them wrapped around my little finger
They were able to make a copy of their victim 's brain
A copy of their brain
Who are they ?
That 's right , I am their ex
I would have known a Iot faster that you led Mom to their death
I just wanted them to know
I just want them back , BIanche
If the documents aren 't there , they decided it
And they always keep it on them
They apologized ; they realized that they had under-estimated me
well I don 't blame them Even I under-estimate myself
Sedative With a dose like that , they could sleep for two days
Why do they want to us to know that ?
The thief ; that 's Poitras , who rigged their fight
And where do they dance ?
I don 't understand why we should give them their share
I asked them to marry me
And what did they answer ?
I Iove them and don 't take me wrong but I Iove them more than I ever loved your mother
Isn 't they a little biased ?
It 's been three days since they disappeared
The woman only talked about their husband who left them
careful , their boyfriend is a hairdresser
You mean their girlfriend is a hairdresser
Why didn 't their powers get passed on ?
They read the book , they had visions
If anyone is capable of saving blanche 's soul , they are
We must do it before they leaves
I 've already told you about the books in which each generation of witches writes their discoveries

Thomas lost their wife
Sarah lost their mother

I was willing to wait for them but their parents wanted to marry off Suzanne first , their older sister
But don 't think they didn 't love their sister

Catherine sacrificed our happiness to offer their sister a normal life
They cried for weeks , but to protect their sister , they decided to have an abortion
And they became obsessed
And their mistress
At least they didn 't look like it
If the discoveries of what 's their name ?
Let them see Armand but no one else
But make sure your daughter stays on our side until Biron has their accident
After that they won 't be able to do anything
What do you think they 'II do once they can search anybody 's brain ?
They hung themselves in their cell
OK , I got them Go call an ambulance , quick !
There 's got to be a clue on their body to lead us to Stef
Didn 't I tell you not to trust them ?

They did what they did
So I wanted to show them that everyone has something to blame themselves for
blanche wanted to skip the thirteenth generation , the thirteenth chapter , the evil one , so they could pass on their powers to someone good
But they failed
That 's what they wanted me to tell you
First , you disrespect my mother 's body , and now , their granddaughter
This little girl is grieving so much since their grandmother died that they haven 't said a word
And you want to make them out to be a demon ?
They said they want to kill me !
You want to burn them right here ?
I want to see them again
We 'II catch them Marcoux
They shot themselves before someone else did
They wouldn 't have killed them for a couple grants
You believe they transmitted their powers , Iike they said ?
BIanche also believed in what they saw except they saw a Iot more and a Iot further than we do
I know you 've secretly been to see them too
Yeah , that 's what they told me at the hospital , word for word
Why would they lie ?
BIanche left them a paper with clues we should follow
I 'd say it looks like you hate them as much as I do
You really think they left their body and saw blanche with wires coming out of their head ?
They can 't leave their wife like this
BIanche 's didn 't tape their meetings with people
the night they were killed , you saw it , you 're sure ?
We have to speak with blanche 's son ; they were in the house too
They must have really loved their GiIbert
According to Mondoux , they were partially buried , and then dragged for a good distance after their death
Why would a killer bring their victim back in their own house ?
Mondoux has tried to contact them but they couldn 't get a hold of them
I wish I 'd figured them out that quickly
They get to you doesn 't they ?
Yes but , it 's important , it might be linked to their death
I don 't want to hear about them or their books anymore , OK ?
We 'II miss them eh ?
BIanche didn 't have one big book ; they had two
I don 't understand ; they hate me
Look at Lapointe who wants to kill me whenever they see me
At their grandmother 's
Yes , when I saw them , they were tied up , they seemed imprisoned
Yet , they gave it to Pierre
Why them ?
They who gathers the mane has seen and will see again
Yeah but with all people that come to see them , it 's kind of normal
Georges , Iet them go
Gastonne loves me because they think I 'm a man
I 'd rather they went away
That 's them !
That 's why blanche gave them the book
Pierre is the heiress to their powers
Better than that , they turn them into images
If they knew I slept with practically everything in a uniform in Great Bear
maybe they won 't say anything at all
If I told Stephanie I 'm still mixed up with my old gang and that I do worse things than before , they wouldn 't understand that I 'm doing it for them
ît 's their heart you betrayed
Biron , they kissed me , right here !
You 're acting just like your father and you always said they were a dumb-ass
The night they died ,
In the woods , someone knocks me out , kills the old lady and tries to bury them but probably gets caught , probably by Sarah and their friends , who , according to Pierre , brought the body home
Come back some other time if you want to play with them , OK ?
Biron , they haven 't said a word
Can 't they mind their own business ?
I just want to know if they saw whoever hurt blanche
I saw them They can 't be very far
Got them !
It 's when they gave us pops the other day
I have to bring them back to their mother if I want to have any fun tonight
They need their father
I just want them to come back
Just want them back
Some hunters found them , Iike that , two weeks later
What did they say ?
Did they give you the idea to talk to Sarah ?
What did they say to you ?
Pierre was at blanche 's house the night they died
They said they saw the kids bring their body back
Like any of the hundreds in their office Great !
If the documents aren 't there , they decided it
In the safe in their office
And they always keep it on them
I just want to talk to them for two minutes
Listen , can you just tell me where I can find them ?
âctually , I 'm certain we 'd find very interesting things in that book they took from blanche 's house
I just want them to come back blanche
Make them come back , I beg of you !
But you know , they aren't really gone yet
You feel them too ?
My grandfather showed them around the mine and the town
When they hear that , my great-aunt is overtaken by vertigo and starts shouting : " Stop !

I know , but if Dove finds you , they 'II kill you
So I bet you 'II make sure they don 't know you 're here

I 'm giving them a chance to earn my trust

But to clinch their route , we needed to find their mountain of iron ,
They gave them a worked copper bell ,
The next few weeks , they tell us , they walked 300 or 400 miles across dry plains into barren mountains ,
This was the kind of religion that Cabeza de Vaca and their friends encountered along this route .
They went to them to become healed and they would go to them just like people would go to a medical doctor today and it 's possible that could have saved their lives .
When Cabeza de Vaca said they were eating worms and spiders , they weren 't telling lies ,
... and they tell us all sorts of fascinating things about the Indians , but they never speaks about theirs or any of their friends ' relationships with the women .

Something has happened to them .
You speak of them as a man situated in between those two cultures .
To we modern people , this is the least believable part of their story ,
And even in their day , they were accused of fantasising ,
The natives were astonished that Cabeza de Vaca and their friends could walk for a whole day without needing food , " But by then , " says Cabeza de Vaca ,
Reading their account , I think that they remained a Christian gentleman ,
But how would Cabeza de Vaca use their knowledge on their return ?
